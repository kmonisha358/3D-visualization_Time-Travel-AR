Discover the Historical Legacy of India with Augmented Reality 🌮🇳

With Time Travel AR, users may visually explore 15 famous landmarks spread across 15 Indian states, each of which represents a distinct period of history and culture. The immersive 3D Augmented Reality experience was created using Unity (URP).

With the use of Unity, C# scripting, Blender, and Sketchfab models, this project blends contemporary technology with heritage visualisation to create an engaging learning experience through interactive 3D models, augmented reality time travel, and educational hints.

# Overview:

Through the creation of a virtual time-travel experience, the Time Travel AR project seeks to unite history and technology. Visitors can visit each Indian state's historical monument, observe it in three dimensions, and engage with it through tags, animations, and voice narration by scanning augmented reality markers or navigating the app.

Constructed using Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP), it provides excellent lighting, shadows, and environmental depth, resulting in a lifelike, realistic, and instructive experience.

# Features:

1) Immersive 3D Visual Environment:
    > Realistic 3D monuments modeled in Blender and sourced from Sketchfab.
    > Dynamic lighting, reflections, and skyboxes for environmental realism.
    > Smooth 360° camera rotation and zoom controls for exploration.
    > Optimized with Unity URP for enhanced rendering performance.

2) Monument Interaction and Animation:
   >  Tap or click to interact with monuments and reveal key information.
   > Floating C#-driven info tags highlighting historical facts, architecture, and timelines.
   > Animated transitions such as gate openings or camera flythroughs for engagement.
  
3) AR-Based Time Travel Functionality:
   > Marker-based AR using Unity’s AR Foundation.
   > Scan state markers to unlock monuments from that region.
   > “Time Slider” to visualize how monuments evolved through centuries.
   > Historical Reconstruction Mode: Compare ancient vs. modern versions of monuments.
   
4) Educational and User Feedback Cues
   > Visual highlights for selected monuments and active interactions.
   > Voice-guided tours and text descriptions for an interactive learning experience.
   > Quiz sections to test users’ knowledge after exploring each monument.
   > Progress badges and achievements for completed state visits.
